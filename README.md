| `LABELS`              | A comma separated string to indicate the labels. Default is 'default'                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `REPO_URL`            | If using a non-organization runner this is the full repository url to register under such as 'https://github.com/tiobe/repo'                                                                                                                                                                  |

Defaults to `github.com`.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
